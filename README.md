# ClockIn ⏱️

ClockIn is a calm, lightweight time tracker that lives in your macOS menu bar. It helps you switch between simple tags and see a clear overview of your day without extra noise. 🌿

The idea is simple: when you quietly log what you’re doing, you start spending time more intentionally. Calendars are great for plans, but they don’t show what actually happened. Plans change, days drift, and it’s easy to forget how time really went. ClockIn gives you an honest, low‑friction record of your day so you can adjust without guilt or complexity.

## Highlights ✨
- One‑tap tag switching from the menu bar ⚡️
- Daily dashboard with totals and timeline 📊
- Custom tags (rename, reorder, hide) 🏷️
- All data stays on your Mac 🔒

## Philosophy 🧭
- Capture reality, not aspirations
- Keep it effortless so you’ll actually use it
- Let awareness drive better choices
